# Lesson 4: Clean up your mess!

Innovate, experiment, but flush when your're done! Don't leave unused resources in your team's AWS accounts.  The Lambdas and API Gateways will only cost you money while used, but the Kinesis streams and DynamoDB tables will charge part of their cost just for existing.  Delete everything when you're done!
